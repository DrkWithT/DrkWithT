- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrkWithT, a CS student transferring to a Cal State! I'm an LA area resident with some dreams.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... mostly web dev with a bit of lower-level C/C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - HTML, CSS, and more JS. Web frameworks such as Flask with Jinja are my favorites!
  - C/C++ Programming with OpenGL 3.3 for x64 ISA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... toy projects within `replit.com`, an online programming environment site!
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - My Discord: `DerkT #0237`
  - [My Dormant Replit](https://replit.com/@thelonecodist)

### Other planned projects:
 1. A redo of my puzzle block game in OpenGL.
 2. A static website for my project links and about me.
 3. Maybe a 2D Minecraft like game.
