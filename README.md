### About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrkWithT, a CS student transferring to a Cal State! I have programmed for 5 years.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing...
  - Server-side web frameworks such as Python Flask.
  - Some Java for network programming.
  - ~~Graphics Programming with OpenGL 3.3 or LWJGL!~~ (On Hold.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever strikes my interest: C projects, Java projects, and maybe programming language implementation.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - My Discord: `DerkT #0237`

### TO DO
 1. Expand on my Java unit converter.
