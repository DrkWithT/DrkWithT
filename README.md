- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrkWithT, a CS student transferring to a Cal State! I have programmed for 5 years.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... mostly backend web dev with a bit of lower-level C/C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - HTML, CSS, and more JS. Server-side web frameworks such as Python Flask are my favorites!
  - Graphics Programming with OpenGL 3.3 or LWJGL!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... toy projects within `replit.com`, an online programming environment site!
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - My Discord: `DerkT #0237`
  - [My Replit](https://replit.com/@thelonecodist)

### Planned projects:
 1. A redo of my puzzle block game as a desktop app. I will use the _NeutralinoJS_ app framework for this.
 2. A static website for my project links and about me.
 3. A Java LWJGL 2D dungeon game.
