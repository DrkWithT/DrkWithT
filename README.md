- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrkWithT, a CS student transferring to a Cal State! I'm an LA area native with some dreams.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... mostly Java and C programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CS, and NodeJS. Web frameworks such as Express & Pug are my favorites!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing Yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (I'll post my discord here later).
